This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Built based on the [example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/XpKrrW) and [requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock) by freeCodeCamp.

See live on [Pomodoro Clock](https://danijels.github.io/pomodoro-clock)

- The user can customize the length of sessions and breaks.
- The timer can be paused at any time.
- A short alarm sound marks the end of each interval.
- There is an option to reset and start an interval from beginning.

## Version 0.1.1

- The timer keeps track of how many sessions (or 'pomodoros') it has been until the fourth.
- Added the option to set the fourth break longer, as suggested in the [original technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
